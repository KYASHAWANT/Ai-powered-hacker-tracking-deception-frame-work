# 🔐 AI-Powered Hacker Tracking and Deception Framework

## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Powered Hacker Tracking and Deception Framework** is a cybersecurity project designed to detect and analyze malicious activities using **deception techniques and AI-based behavior analysis**.
Instead of blocking attackers immediately, the system redirects them to a **fake SSH environment**, allowing safe monitoring of their actions without affecting real systems.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional security systems like firewalls and intrusion detection tools are mostly reactive and struggle to detect new or unknown attack methods.
Hackers often use VPNs, encrypted connections, and advanced tools, making detection difficult.
This project addresses the need for an **intelligent system** that can safely trap attackers, study their behavior, and improve security without risking real infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

* Detect malicious users using AI-based behavior analysis
* Create a deceptive **fake SSH environment** to trap attackers
* Monitor login attempts, commands, and session activity
* Record attacker details such as IP address and timestamps
* Display attacker activity using dashboards
* Generate attacker profiles and security reports
* Reduce false positives and improve overall system security

---

## 🛠️ System Architecture & Workflow

1. Attacker attempts to connect using SSH
2. Connection is redirected to a fake SSH server
3. Login attempts are captured and logged
4. A fake Linux shell environment is provided
5. Attacker executes commands inside the fake system
6. System records commands, keystrokes, IP address, and session data
7. AI-based analysis identifies suspicious behavior patterns
8. Logs are stored securely
9. Dashboards display real-time activity
10. Attacker reports are generated
